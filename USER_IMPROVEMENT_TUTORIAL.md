# Improving the PSMG Agent Lottie User Experience: A Step-by-Step Guide

This tutorial will walk you through the most impactful improvements you can make to the PSMG Agent Lottie application to benefit your users. We’ll focus on accessibility, user feedback, privacy, and mobile responsiveness.

## 1. Add Accessibility Features

**Why:** Ensures everyone, including users with disabilities, can interact with your site.

**How:**
- Add `aria-label` attributes to all form fields and buttons.
- Use semantic HTML elements like `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<form>`.
- Check color contrast using tools like [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).

**Example:**
```html
<input id="f_full_name" type="text" readonly aria-label="Full name" placeholder="(not provided)">
```

## 2. Improve User Feedback and Error Handling

**Why:** Users should know what’s happening, especially if something goes wrong.

**How:**
- Show a loading spinner while the agent widget loads.
- Display a clear error message if the widget fails or if required fields are missing.
- Allow users to edit their prefilled details if they spot a mistake.

**Example:**
```html
<div id="loading" style="display:none;">Loading agent...</div>
<script>
  document.getElementById('loading').style.display = 'block';
  // Hide when widget is ready
</script>
```

## 3. Add a Privacy Notice and Data Controls

**Why:** Builds trust by being transparent about data usage.

**How:**
- Add a visible privacy notice explaining what data is collected and why.
- Provide a checkbox or link to opt out of analytics.
- Mask sensitive data in analytics payloads (e.g., only send part of the email).

**Example:**
```html
<p class="muted">We use your details to personalize your experience. <a href="/privacy">Learn more</a></p>
```

## 4. Enhance Mobile Responsiveness

**Why:** Many users will access the site on mobile devices.

**How:**
- Test the site on various devices and screen sizes.
- Increase button and link sizes for easier tapping.
- Use responsive CSS (media queries) to adjust layout.

**Example:**
```css
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  .fields { grid-template-columns: 1fr; }
  .btn { padding: 16px 24px; font-size: 18px; }
}
```

## 5. Move JavaScript to a Separate File

**Why:** Improves maintainability and page load speed.

**How:**
- Create a new file, e.g., `main.js`.
- Move all inline `<script>` code into this file.
- Reference it in your HTML: `<script src="main.js"></script>`
