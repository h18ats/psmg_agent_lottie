# Recommendations for Improving the PSMG Agent Lottie User Experience

Based on the current implementation in `index.html`, here are actionable recommendations to enhance usability, accessibility, privacy, and maintainability:

## 1. Accessibility Improvements
- **Add ARIA labels and roles** to form fields and interactive elements for better screen reader support.
- **Ensure color contrast** meets WCAG guidelines, especially for text on colored backgrounds.
- **Enable keyboard navigation** for all interactive elements, including the agent widget.

## 2. User Feedback & Error Handling
- **Show loading indicators** when the agent widget is initializing or waiting for a response.
- **Display error messages** if required identity fields are missing or if the widget fails to load.
- **Allow users to edit their details** if the prefilled information is incorrect.

## 3. Privacy & Transparency
- **Add a privacy notice** explaining how user data and UTM parameters are used and stored.
- **Provide an option to opt out** of analytics or data sharing.
- **Mask or obfuscate sensitive data** in analytics payloads where possible.

## 4. Mobile Responsiveness
- **Test and optimize layout** for various mobile devices and screen sizes.
- **Increase touch target sizes** for buttons and links.

## 5. Code Maintainability
- **Move inline JavaScript to a separate file** for better organization and caching.
- **Use semantic HTML5 elements** (e.g., `<main>`, `<section>`, `<form>`) for structure.
- **Add comments and documentation** to clarify logic, especially around UTM handling and widget integration.

## 6. Widget Integration
- **Validate the dynamic variables** before passing to the widget to avoid malformed data.
- **Handle widget events** (e.g., conversation started, error) to provide feedback or analytics.

## 7. Performance
- **Defer or async-load non-critical scripts** to speed up initial page load.
- **Optimize images** (e.g., use modern formats, set width/height attributes) for faster rendering.

## 8. Internationalization
- **Support multiple languages** if the audience is international.
- **Externalize user-facing text** for easier translation.

Implementing these recommendations will improve the overall user experience, accessibility, and trust in the PSMG Agent Lottie application.
